Exercise 3

1. Write a program containing a loop that iterates from 1 to 1000 using a variable I,
which is incremented each time around the loop. The program should output the
value of I every hundred iterations (i.e., the output should be 100, 200, etc.).

>  create table tempp (nos int);
	
>	delimiter //
	create procedure itr(y int)
	begin 
		declare a int default 0;
		while a<y do
				set a=a+100;
				insert into tempp values(a); 
		end while;
	end; //
	delimiter ;

>	call itr(1000);
>	select * from tempp;


2. Write a program that examines all the numbers from 1 to 999, displaying all those
for which the sum of the cubes of the digits equal the number itself.

>  create table tempp (Amstrongno Varchar(100));

> delimiter //
  create procedure amstrong()
  begin
		declare a int ;
        declare r int default 0;
        declare sum int default 0;
        declare it int default 0;
        while it<=999 do
				set it=it+1;
                set r=0;
                set sum=0;
				set a=it;
				while a>0 do
						set r=mod(a,10);
                        set sum=sum+pow(r,3);
						set a=floor(a/10);
				end while;
                if sum=it then 
						insert into tempp values(concat(it," is Amstrong no."));
				end if;
		end while;
    end; //
  delimiter ;

> call amstrong();

>select * from tempp;



3. Write a program that Selects from any table a minimum and maximum value for a
radius, along with an increment factor, and generates a series of radii by repeatedly
adding the increment to the minimum until the maximum is reached. For each value
of the radius, compute and display the circumference, area, and volume of the
sphere. (Be sure to include both the maximum and the minimum values.).



4. A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same forward and backward, such as
level, radar, etc. Write a program to Selects from any table a five letter word and
determine whether it is a palindrome.



5. Modify the above program to Select from any table a variable length word. This
requires determining how many characters are read in.
